# Advanced usage

## Use with other libaries

Doing everything is a pretty hard gig.
Luckily this works great with other libraries!

### [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group)

Useful when you have a CSS transition you want to happen when an element is entering or leaving,
for example here in our _tripe.com_ menu we use it for just that!

<Playground>
  <TripeHoverMenu />
</Playground>

```js
({ isMenuShown, shownMenuId }) => (
  <CSSTransition in={isMenuShown} unmountOnExit mountOnEnter timeout={{ enter: 0, exit: 100 }}>
    <div class="menu-container">
      <ReshapingContainer triggerKey={shownMenuId}>hello world</ReshapingContainer>
    </div>
  </CSSTransition>
);
```

> **Tip -** This example is using the [ReshapingContainer](/reshaping-container) component.
> It will reshape the background around the children when its prop `triggerKey` changes!

### [Popmotion](https://popmotion.io/pure/)

Creating [custom motions](/custom-motions) with third party libraries works a treat,
remember that although this comes with beautiful motions out of the box -
at its core is a powerful orchestration layer you can use to write your own!

Here we use Popmotion to do the animating.

<Playground>
  <Common.Toggler interval>
    {toggler => (
      <Motion triggerSelfKey={toggler.shown}>
        <PopmotionMoveRight>{motion => <Styled.Root {...motion} />}</PopmotionMoveRight>
      </Motion>
    )}
  </Common.Toggler>
</Playground>

> **Tip -** [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) can also be used for similar results using its imperative [Manual API](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/props/gotchas#manual-api).

```js
import { Collector } from '@element-motion/core';
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { styler, tween } from 'popmotion';

const PopmotionMoveRight = props => {
  const elementStyler = useRef();

  return (
    <Collector
      data={{
        action: 'motion',
        payload: {
          beforeAnimate: (elements, onFinish, setChildProps) => {
            elementStyler.current = styler(elements.destination.element);
            onFinish();
          },
          animate: (elements, onFinish, setChildProps) => {
            tween({ from: 0, to: { x: 300 } }).start({
              complete: onFinish,
              update: elementStyler.current,
            });
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </Collector>
  );
};
```

## Controlling in what order motions should execute

> **Tip -** motions have three phases,
> `beforeAnimate()`,
> `animate()` and `afterAnimate()`.
> Don't worry if you're confused we will go over them in detail in [Custom motions](/custom-motions).

Motions are executed from top to bottom.
The parent-most motion will be executed first and then continue execution inwards.

So if we had two motions, Move and CrossFade:

```js
() => (
  <Motion name="move-first">
    <Move>
      <CrossFade>{motion => <div {...motion} />}</CrossFade>
    </Move>
  </Motion>
);
```

When executed the order would look like:

1. Move `beforeAnimate()` fired
1. CrossFade `beforeAnimate()` fired
1. Move `animate()` fired
1. CrossFade `animate()` fired
1. Move `afterAnimate()` fired
1. CrossFade `afterAnimate()` fired

<br />

If we placed CrossFade first:

```js
() => (
  <Motion name="cross-fade-first">
    <CrossFade>
      <Move>{motion => <div {...motion} />}</Move>
    </CrossFade>
  </Motion>
);
```

Then their order would be inversed:

1. CrossFade `beforeAnimate()` fired
1. Move `beforeAnimate()` fired
1. CrossFade `animate()` fired
1. Move `animate()` fired
1. CrossFade `afterAnimate()` fired
1. Move `afterAnimate()` fired

## Wait for the previous motion to finish before starting the next

Depending on the motions chosen you'll want to defer starting one until the previous has finished.
Luckily the [Wait](/wait) component has been made for that!

Continuing the example above,
if we introduce the Wait component:

```js
import { Wait } from '@element-motion/core';

() => (
  <Motion name="wait">
    <CrossFade>
      <Wait>
        <Move>{motion => <div {...motion} />}</Move>
      </Wait>
    </CrossFade>
  </Motion>
);
```

Then the Move motion will wait for the CrossFade motion to complete finish before starting,
the order then becoming:

1. CrossFade `beforeAnimate()` fired
1. CrossFade `animate()` fired
1. Move `beforeAnimate()` fired
1. Move `animate()` fired
1. CrossFade `afterAnimate()` fired
1. Move `afterAnimate()` fired

> **Tip -** Notice that afterAnimate's are always called the the same regardless of Wait usage.

## Delay showing content until all motions have finished

Occasionally when initiating a motion we can have some secondary content we want to keep hidden until the motion has finished.
Luckily [VisibilityManager](/visibility-manager) exists to do just that!
Make it a parent of any [Motion](/motion) and it will show its content only when the motion has finished.

```js
import { VisibilityManager } from '@element-motion/core';

() => (
  <VisibilityManager>
    {manager => (
      <div>
        <Motion name="hide-children-until-motions-have-finished">
          <CrossFade>
            <Move>{motion => <div {...motion} />}</Move>
          </CrossFade>
        </Motion>

        <span {...manager}>Children content</span>
      </div>
    )}
  </VisibilityManager>
);
```

Children content will be shown after **all** motions have completed.

> **Tip -** If you have multiple child [Motion](/motion) you can pass [VisibilityManager](/visibility-manager) a `name` prop to target a specific [Motion](/motion).

## Using supporting motions

While movement is a large part - we can do so much more!
When building a great user experience its also useful to have supporting motion to help seamlessly transition from one state to another.

Two extra tools we have to do this is [CircleExpand](/circle-expand) and [CircleShrink](/circle-shrink) motions,
used together can produce a really cool transition between states.

<Playground>
  <Styled.Center>
    <Common.SmallViewport>
      <Common.Toggler>
        {({ shown, toggle }) => (
          <div id="yo">
            {!shown ? (
              <Styled.Container>
                <Motion name="circle-expand-square" key="1">
                  <CircleExpand background="#fea3aa">
                    {motion => <Styled.Root onClick={() => toggle()} {...motion} />}
                  </CircleExpand>
                </Motion>
              </Styled.Container>
            ) : (
              <VisibilityManager>
                {props => (
                  <Styled.Container
                    onClick={() => toggle()}
                    style={{ cursor: 'pointer', background: '#005aff', ...props.style }}
                  >
                    <Motion name="circle-expand-square" key="2">
                      <CircleShrink background="#005aff">
                        {motion => <div {...motion} />}
                      </CircleShrink>
                    </Motion>
                  </Styled.Container>
                )}
              </VisibilityManager>
            )}
          </div>
        )}
      </Common.Toggler>
    </Common.SmallViewport>
  </Styled.Center>
</Playground>

> **Tip -** [VisibilityManager](/visibility-manager) has been used as well to hide the next contents until the motion has finished,
> resulting in that crisp transition.

## Moving using a focal target

At times we want to move all content at once but have it originate from a focal point.
The [FocalTarget](/focal-target) component exists to mark the focal element so motions who care can use it.
Two examples of motions who can use it are [Move](/move), [FocalConcealMove](/focal-conceal-move).

<Playground>
  <Styled.Center>
    <EmailChain />
  </Styled.Center>
</Playground>
